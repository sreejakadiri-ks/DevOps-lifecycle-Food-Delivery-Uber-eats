üì¶ DevOps Lifecycle for a Food Delivery App
DevOps is a set of practices that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to shorten the development lifecycle and deliver high-quality software continuously. For a food delivery app, DevOps ensures that features like restaurant search, order placement, real-time tracking, and payment work smoothly.

üîÅ DevOps Lifecycle Stages
1. Plan
Goal: Define features like real-time tracking, payment systems, user login, delivery partner app, etc.

Activities:

Collect feedback from users and restaurants.

Use tools like JIRA, Trello, or Azure Boards to manage requirements and tasks.

2. Develop
Goal: Build the application code for different modules ‚Äì user app, delivery app, restaurant dashboard.

Activities:

Use frameworks like React Native, Flutter, or Android Studio.

Collaborate using Git with platforms like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.

3. Build & Integrate (CI)
Goal: Automatically compile and test the code.

Activities:

Use CI tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or CircleCI.

Combine code from multiple developers and ensure it works together.

4. Test
Goal: Ensure app works properly (no bugs).

Activities:

Automated testing of order placement, payment flow, location tracking.

Use testing tools like Selenium, JUnit, or Appium.

5. Release
Goal: Push the tested version to users.

Activities:

Release updates on Play Store and App Store.

Use version control and tagging to manage releases.

6. Deploy
Goal: Automatically deploy new features to servers.

Activities:

Use containerization with Docker and orchestration with Kubernetes.

Use AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalable hosting.

7. Operate
Goal: Run the app efficiently with high availability.

Activities:

Monitor server health, performance, and scalability.

Use tools like Prometheus, Grafana, New Relic.

8. Monitor & Feedback
Goal: Continuously track performance and gather user feedback.

Activities:

Get real-time feedback on delivery issues, app crashes, delays.

Use logs and tools like ELK Stack, Datadog, or Sentry.
